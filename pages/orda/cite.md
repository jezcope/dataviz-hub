Title: Guidance on citing data
---
If you create a visualisation which you wish to publish in ORDA, but published separately to the data visualised (i.e. has a separate ORDA record to the visualisation, or is not published in ORDA), you will need to correctly cite these data. Please see our guidance on citing data at https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm/citation
